## Introduction

This is a tutorial to help first-time contributors participate in a simple and easy project.

### Objectives

- Make a contribution to an open source project.
- Get more comfortable using GitHub.

### Who is this for?

- This is for absolute beginners. If you know how to write and edit an anchor tag `<a href="" target=""></a>`, then you should be able to do it.
- It is also for those with a little more experience who want to make their first open source contribution or get more contributions for more experience and confidence.

### Why do I need to do this?

Any web developer, aspiring or experienced, needs to use Git version control, and GitHub is the most popular Git hosting service used by everyone. It is also the heart of the Open Source community. Getting comfortable using GitHub is an essential skill. Making a contribution to a project boosts your confidence and gives you something to show on your GitHub profile.

If you are a new developer and you are wondering if you need to learn Git and GitHub, then here is the answer: [You Should've Learned Git Yesterday](https://codeburst.io/number-one-piece-of-advice-for-new-developers-ddd08abc8bfa 'New Developer? You shouldâ€™ve learned Git yesterday. by Brandon Morelli, creator of CodeBurst.io').

### What am I going to contribute?

![Contributor Card](/readme-only/card.PNG 'Contributor Card')

You are going to contribute a card just like this one to this [project's web page](https://syknapse.github.io/Contribute-To-This-Project/ 'https://syknapse.github.io/Contribute-To-This-Project'). It will include your name, your Twitter handle, a short description, and three links to useful resources for web developers that you recommend.

You will make a copy of the card template inside the HTML file and customize it with your own information.

### Setup! :)

Note: This Tutorial is based on GitHub PC. [If you're comfortable with the terminal go to this tutorial (Click Here)](/terminal_tutorial.md)

1. Login to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have an account, then [join GitHub](https://github.com/join). I recommend that you do the [GitHub Hello World tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) before you continue.
2. Download [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).
   - Alternatively, if you are comfortable using Git on the command line, you can do so [Here](/terminal_tutorial.md).
